Disclaimer: I am a huge fan of the LLM revolution.  I have written code for around 20 years and the magic of havng an informed, skilled partner to assist with coding has been the biggest revolution since the Internet and smart phones.

The possibility of using LLM's as a curiosity engine, could be the biggest change to education in a long, long time.

While I am very excited by the possibility I see a few drawbacks as implemented today:

- The Singularity and Disposability of AI Conversations
The beauty of human conversations lies in their ephemerality and their ability to be recalled, studied, and learned from. But for AI, conversations are inherently singular and disposable. Once an interaction with AI is over, the conversation evaporates into the digital ether, leaving no traces. This makes it challenging for AI to learn from past conversations and improve future interactions, thus hindering the knowledge acquisition process.

- The Invisible Reasoning Process
What makes a conversation rich and insightful is not merely the conclusions drawn but the process of reasoning that leads to them. However, in AI conversations, the reasoning process remains unseen. We can only assess the final conclusions, but the underlying thought process remains a black box. This lack of transparency can lead to confusion, misunderstanding, and even mistrust in AI systems.

- The Importance of Conversations in Learning
Learning is an active process that thrives on interactions, debates, and discussions. It is through these conversations that we build empathy, challenge assumptions, and refine our understanding of big ideas. But when AI can't communicate with others or share its reasoning process, it misses out on these crucial learning opportunities.
