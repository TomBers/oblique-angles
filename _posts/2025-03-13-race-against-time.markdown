This morning I watched the documentary "The Mirage: Timothy Olson's Race Against Time" on National Geographic.

It falls well under the inspiring story trope.  Perserverence through extreme acts of endurance / masochism.  A couple of things stood out to me, the first was in the act of jutifying the actions,
dragging his whole family and support team on a tedious journey for his own goal. One thing he said was it was his attempt to come to terms with himself and something about acceptance.  It seemed absurd to me that this spiritual journey was both clearly sponsored by Addidas (including his kids clothing), and was to be extensively filmed.
The true reflection that even self-knowledge is a platform for observation by others; an opportunity for monetization.

The second reflection is that how every documentary has to be about "everything".  We do not just witness a awe-inspiring athetletic achievment, but also has to deal with past alcholism, the redeption arc has to be in full display to fufill its narrative effect.  The full ideology on display, self-denial, corporate sponsorship and returning to the right path.

What would the opposite of this documentary be?  I would love to see a comedy sketch about an ultra-runner who's heros journey is a turn from athletic feats to pure hedonism.

Structure:

- Interview showing the extreme lengths they used to go to - 5AM runs, staring longingly at running shoes, collapsing after a long run.
- Training montage, showing drinking vodka shots for reps, snorting coke, awkwardly sitting in a stripclub.
- Relapse, camera catches him returning after a late night run, faced by family and friends who encourage him to drink / smoke / party.
- Interview with wife.  I just want him to be interesting.  During the worst times we would have multi-hour discussions on running shoes.  Now he is much more interesting.
