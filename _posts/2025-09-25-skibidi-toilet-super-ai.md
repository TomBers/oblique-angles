### What is a good way to test for better than human intelligence?

One that is easy to verify and not hugely tied to a specific domain - Chess, Go, Protein folding etc?

### History

For a long time the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test){:target="_blank"} was the gold standard for artificial intelligence, but having blown past that with out much funfair we are unsure what a true test of general super intelligence is.

There is a good chance that super intelligence methods are unrecognisable to us, but a test of the results could be easy.

### Proposal - The Skibidi toilet test

For the uninitiated, Skibidi toilet is a viral meme / web-series prominently featuring a man's head in a toilet (singing?). That might end up as a Hollywood movie [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/05/21/its-official-michael-bay-will-direct-the-skibidi-toilet-movie/){:target="_blank"}

Having long ago left my youth, I look at it with a mixture of bafflement and surprise.  What even is it? Why is it popular?
But [the numbers](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tzD9OxAHtzU){:target="_blank"} don't lie(?), it is hugely popular and entered my mind unbidden.

So the test is very simple:

> Could an artificial intelligence create a piece of media on demand that reached similar levels of cultural impact as Skibidi toilet?

### Why I think this could be useful?

* This is not currently humanly possible.
  * Many try, and some are better than others, but it is fundamentally impossible to predict.

* Out of distribution
  * By definition it has to be something unique, eliciting a `thats cool` response.

* Models other minds
  * The tone \ content \ semiotics has to speak to a large enough group of people and worth sharing.

* Surfing the [Geist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geist){:target="_blank"}
  * To both understand and respond to the Geist, to directly observe the `anima mundi, spiritus universi`
