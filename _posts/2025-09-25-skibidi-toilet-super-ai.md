## What is a good way to test for better than human intelligence?

One that is easy to verify and not hugely tied to a domain (e.g Chess, Go, Protein folding etc)

## History

For a long time the Turing Test was the gold standard for human level intelligence (AGI) [Insert Intro], but having blown past that with out much fun fair we are unsure what a true test of general super intelligence is.

There is a good chance that super intelligence methods are unreocgnisable to us, but a test of the results could be easy.

## Proposal - The Skibidi toilet test

For the uninitated, Skibidi toilet is a viral meme / webseries prominantly featuring a man's head in a toilet (singing?). That might end up a hollywood movie [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/05/21/its-official-michael-bay-will-direct-the-skibidi-toilet-movie/)

Having long ago left my youth, I look at it with a mixture of bafflement and surprise.  What even is it? Why is it popular?
But the numbers don't lie(?), it is hugely popular and entered my mind unbidden.

So the test is very simple, could an artifical intelligence create a piece of media on demand that reached similar levels of cultural impact?

## Why I think this could be useful?

This is not currently humanly possible.
It happens at random, for unclear reasons [Side note about Geist]

### Out of distribution

By definition it has to be something unique, illiciting a `thats cool` response

### Models other minds

The tone \ content \ semiotics has to speak to group of people enough to share

### Competitive Information Environment

Entering the 'Market Place of Ideas' is a competition with every other voice speaking at the same time.  It takes a complex set of circumstances to be heard.
