# tldr:
2 experiments in using LLM's as an augmented-writing tool.

# Experiment - I want want to write about Robert Pirsig ideas about quality.

I remember it having a large impact on me when I first read it many years ago.  But  I have fogot many of the details of the book.

There is a certain irony to testing auto-writing tools on the work of someone who so clearly focused on craftmanship and quality.  A little bit of sacrilege goes a long way.

2 methods to compare:

1. Using a 1 shot approach using the latest OpenAI model - you can see the [prompt and code here](https://github.com/TomBers/oblique-angles/blob/main/gen_post.exs)

2. [MuDG](https://tombers.github.io/dialectic/) - is a creative tool that utilises LLM's to provide a creative partner in the writing process.  As well as having a sharing page so people can explore your thought process and add to it.

My starting point are the notes I have prepared:

"Robert Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintenance and Lila.
Illustrating the ideas of quality, a metaphysics pre-language."

You can see the results here:
