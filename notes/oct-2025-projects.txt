Projects summary October 2025

Main Project:

MuDG:

Collaborative learning tool based on LLM's.

Direct LLM ansers into a graph datastucture, allowing further depth of different routes, drilling down into the specifics of a topic and learning related topics.

Innovations:

Make AI conversations public allowing others to contribute to the learning process and correct potential rabbit holes.
Store as a graph, so you can branch and combine different parts of a conversation.
Visualisation and storage so knowlegde can be built over time

Games Projects:

WordGo

Explore how AI tools to make new games possible.  Specifically word distance.  For the first time we can treat words as numbers (vectors) and
ask question like, "how similar are these 2 words".  Using that as a base, the game uses a Go like board where players place pieces, each piece is associated with a word,
the scoring is a balance of positional play and the similairy of the words choosen.

TimeLine

How well do you know your history?  Put these events in historical order.  Two modes, drop the events into the buckets, or full timeline with duration and
overlapping time periods.

Ongoing experiment:

Statelang

An experiment to think about programming in a state first manner. Exploring how we can reframe software design by centering on state, and let the rest of the applications, whether itâ€™s a web, API, or mobile apps be automatically derived from that state machine.
