Reflections on customer interview

A couple of days ago I spoke with (a potential) customer, and it was very helpful, in both ideas
and dealing with my own discomfort.

It can be very difficult when you have invested time and effort into a project to hear it either dismssed or misunderstood.

What I saw the point of MuDG as?
A response to:
- Noisy Addictive Interfaces (Discord, Slack & Twitter)
- LLM converdations are never returned to, easier to start a new one
- Difficult to follow conversations that are branching, Give Philosopher examples

Customer realisation
- After 20mins before it clicked
- Objections
- Why not use - Obsidian, LLM, Wikipedia

Lack of Virality
- Challenge of quick flshy answer (Swimming against the tide).
The project aims to have some deeper value, to challenge and deepen understanding.
One other project they mentioned.
Tik-tok Wikipedia - social wave, https://wikitok.vercel.app/
I can see why this is popular, and how it can be shared easily, but I wonder on the actual long lasting educational value.



The importance of Demo, I showed 3 specific examples.
-> On third time it seemed to click
Are you demoing what you think you are demoing?

Passivitisation
Pull towards automatic systems
Not only answer questions - but suggest them
Suggested removing the option to actual ask your own questions but to have buttons with potential questions.  The trade off of auomation of thought vs augmentation of thought.
Easier == Better??
Fricition as Filter

 Persoanal use -> Solving your own problem

Concepts of Ownership, I would like people to "own" their graphs, but have seen the corruption of entities such as Mozilla and Wikipedia, that have been hijacked by a small number of people.
