Wordgo | Using Neural Networks to open a new area of gaming

The ability to treat words as numbers (vectors) opens up a whole new category of gaming possibilities.

By tokenising words, we get to treat a word as a number with geometric properties.  The classic example is Cosine distance which allows us to score the semantic similarity of words.

This makes things quantifiable and scorable.

The idea of WordGo is to combine vocabulary with positional awareness.

WordGo is a strategic turn-based game that combines vocabulary and tactical positioning.
Players create words on a game board while competing to claim randomly placed bonus tiles (2x and 4x multipliers) and achieve the highest score.
The game rewards thematic word clusters - when words sharing similar meanings or topics are placed physically adjacent to each other (connecting up, down, left, or right), they earn bonus points.
For example, placing fruit words like Apple, Banana, and Cherry next to each other will yield a higher score than scattered unrelated words like Moon, Wall, and Red.
Choose from three play modes: single-player practice, competitive multiplayer, or challenge an AI opponent.[Insert screen shot]

Dynamic balance of position and eord choice.  The game rewards good positional play along with good word clustering.
