Mass competition, tension between me as a consumer vs me as a creator.

Consumer has never had it better, almost infinite choice.  Cheap abundant, the best of entire histroy.

As a creator, competition, high bar.

imagine being a musician before the age of recording, you could make a living playing live, you only needed to be good in comparison to your town / locale.  Worse music but more creative.
