Today Wed 19th March 2025.  I was working on what is a techncially very simple feature, but has a big impact on readability.

In MuDG, I added a feature to read the graph as a threaded conversation (a more linear, familiar format).  This feature allows users to navigate the graph more easily and understand the relationships between nodes.

The first version of this was just rendering the nodes as a flat list indented to represent depth.  This morning, I added a simple toggle to hide and show text and a button to expand / collapse all nodes.

I think the result is quite satisfying. The toggle allows users to focus on the structure of the graph without getting overwhelmed by the text, while the expand/collapse button provides a quick way to explore deeper levels of the graph. This makes it easier for users to understand the relationships between nodes and navigate the graph more efficiently.

Compare below with the previous version:
