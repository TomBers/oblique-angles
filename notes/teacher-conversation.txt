Title - The human says no.  Reflections on a conversation with a teacher

I was recently at a friends birthday.  By chance I was sitting by a history teacher.  As someone who
interested in the impact of AI careers and industries I asked him his thoughts.

There was an instant freeze in his manner, that I had brought up something that was both obvious and tedious.

His position was that it would have between zero and negative effect on education.  How people learn was a 'solved' problem and
fundamentally analogue process (his words).

He had be singularly unimpressed with the results and gave an example of a student handing in an essay that confabulated a particular organisation and had mixed Karl Marx and Adam Smith to a new invented person Karl Smith or Adam Marx (I forget the mixup)

I had countered that as a software developer I had been impressed and that in many ways it is a better software developer than I am despite 20 years of professional experience (I will leave it to the reader to reach their own conclusions)

The teacher went on to theorise that while AI will never be great at "facts" but conceeded that perhaps code had different properties.

He also mentioned that being trained on the internet corpus it was filled with bias and "slop".

I took a few things away from the conversation.
1) A complete lack of curiosity, that a conclusion had be made and there was no moving from that position.
2) That his field was essentially solved, and his role in it essential.
3) A distate to revisiting "settled" arguments.  While I can see some of the issues around halluncinations having some validity years ago, in my experence they are far less prominant give the huge improvments.
