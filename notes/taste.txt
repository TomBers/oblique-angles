On of the challenges as a software developer are questions of taste.

There can be a huge difference between the technical challenge of implementing something and the impact it can have.

As a developer it can be tempting to see these things as un-important as they are such a trivial change, but the impact can be significant, perhaps even the difference between success and failure.

One example I worked on tdoay.  I am dealing with graphs that can expand downward or upward (see screenshots)

The actual change is

```js
layout: {
    name: 'dagre',
    rankDir: 'BT' or 'TB',
    }
```

The psycology of growing knowledge or digging down. Which is right - it is impossible to say, a matter of individual taste.

So you either bet on your individual taste or if you are large enough run A/B tests.
