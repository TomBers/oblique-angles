The quest to know everything.

Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (I am man, nothing that is human is indifferent to me)

Outline:
Why?

Many years ago, I was living in a flat that was a converted hospital from the Crimean war, staffed by Florance Nightingale.  The slightly odd layout of the flat had a 3/4 roof high storage space that in the center of the flat, creating the main living area.  This created a large wall with space on top.  I had the idea of getting a large industrial roll of paper and trying to write out every single thing I knew.

Large diagram with links between places, ideas, books, music. movies etc.  I wanted to join everything I had ever thought into some sort of structure, a non-linear diary.

I ended up leaving the flat, lost track of the diagram, but the idea remained.

The goal?

What if you could map everything?  Connect ideas and follow them as far as you wish?
What of you could get answers to any question, define key terms, find specific thinkers or real world examples.?
What if you challenge ideas to get the pros and cons, or generate a synthesis of 2 ideas?
What if you could share them or just specific thoughts?
What if you could actually build them collabratively, with many people working at the same time to build a structure of interest?


How?
